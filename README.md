### **Introduction**

Modern democracies face a significant challenge in managing the steady growth of regulations and administrative rules, a phenomenon often referred to as "rule growth" or "regulatory inflation." While regulations are essential for addressing societal needs and ensuring governance, unchecked growth can lead to inefficiencies, administrative burdens, and a decline in public trust in institutions. This challenge is particularly acute in diverse governance contexts, from well-established democracies in Europe to transitional systems in regions like the Middle East. This research plan is positioned within the EU-funded project "Sustaining Public Administration in Modern Democracies" (SUPA), which seeks to develop strategies for sustainable policy management and public administration.

Rule-offsetting schemes, a relatively novel approach to managing rule growth, have emerged as a potential solution. These schemes require policymakers to remove existing regulations before introducing new ones, aiming to maintain a balance between necessary governance and administrative feasibility. While these mechanisms have been lauded for their potential to curb regulatory inflation, their implementation and effectiveness vary widely across political and institutional settings. This research seeks to evaluate the utility of rule-offsetting schemes in sustaining public administration and ensuring democratic resilience, focusing on six European countries and drawing comparative insights from governance systems in the Middle East, particularly Iraq.

The research is grounded in a multidisciplinary approach, integrating insights from political science, public administration, and comparative politics. It leverages both qualitative and quantitative methodologies to analyze patterns of rule growth, the design and outcomes of rule-offsetting mechanisms, and the contextual factors influencing their effectiveness. Drawing on my lived experience in Iraq and exile in Europe, this study also explores how different governance systems adapt to regulatory challenges, providing a unique perspective that bridges academic inquiry and real-world application.

This research is particularly relevant in todayâ€™s rapidly changing political landscape, where governments must navigate complex societal demands, technological advancements, and global crises. By addressing the sustainability of public administration, the study contributes to the broader goals of the SUPA project and offers actionable insights for policymakers. The findings aim to inform the design of more resilient governance frameworks, fostering trust and efficiency in both established and transitional democracies.

The subsequent sections outline the research problem, objectives, literature review, methodology, timeline, and expected contributions of this study, providing a comprehensive plan for investigating rule-offsetting schemes within the framework of sustainable governance.

### **Literature Review**

#### **Regulatory Inflation and Its Impacts**

Regulatory inflation refers to the unchecked growth of rules and regulations over time, which can lead to inefficiencies, increased costs, and diminished trust in governance. Scholars such as Lodge and Wegrich (2014) argue that excessive regulation can stifle innovation, burden businesses, and create bureaucratic bottlenecks. Public sector scholars highlight the need for a balance between responsiveness to emerging challenges and the sustainability of administrative systems.

#### **Rule-Offsetting Mechanisms: An Overview**

Rule-offsetting schemes, such as OIOO and OITO, aim to curb regulatory inflation by requiring that new rules be offset by the elimination of existing ones. First implemented in countries like the United Kingdom and Canada, these schemes have since been adopted or considered by several other democracies. 

Proponents argue that rule-offsetting fosters regulatory discipline, reduces bureaucratic red tape, and enhances administrative efficiency. However, critics warn of potential unintended consequences, such as the elimination of valuable regulations and the prioritization of quantity over quality. Empirical evaluations, including those by OECD (2019), reveal mixed outcomes, underscoring the need for context-specific analyses.

#### **Comparative Perspectives**

Most studies on rule-offsetting focus on developed democracies, with limited attention to transitional or non-Western systems. This research seeks to fill this gap by incorporating insights from the Middle East, particularly Iraq. Governance in Iraq is characterized by rapid regulatory changes, often driven by political instability and external pressures, making it an ideal case for comparison.

#### **Theoretical Gaps**

While existing research explores the mechanics of rule-offsetting, little attention has been paid to its intersection with administrative capacity, cultural norms, and political will. This study integrates these dimensions to provide a holistic understanding of rule-offsetting in diverse contexts.

### **Theoretical Framework**

The research draws on three interrelated theoretical frameworks:

1. **Institutional Theory**
   - This framework examines how formal rules, informal norms, and cultural practices shape governance processes. It provides insights into how rule-offsetting interacts with existing institutional arrangements, highlighting factors that facilitate or hinder its implementation.

2. **Administrative Capacity Theory**
   - This theory focuses on the resources, skills, and organizational structures needed for effective governance. Rule-offsetting aims to align policy growth with administrative capacity, making this framework central to understanding its impact.

3. **Comparative Governance Theory**
   - Comparative governance theory provides tools for analyzing differences and similarities across political systems. By comparing European democracies and Middle Eastern contexts, this framework helps identify transferable lessons and contextual constraints.
